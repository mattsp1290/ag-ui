## 🧑‍💻 Want to Contribute Code?

1. **Find Something to Work On**  
   Browse open issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/issues).  
   Got your own idea? Open an issue first so we can start the discussion.

2. **Ask to Be Assigned**  
   Comment on the issue and tag a code owner:  
   → [Code Owners](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS)

3. **Get on the Roadmap**  
   Once approved, you'll be assigned the issue, and it'll get added to our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ag-ui-protocol/projects/1).

4. **Coordinate With Others**  
   - If you're collaborating or need feedback, start a thread in `#-💎-contributing` on Discord  
   - Or just DM the assignee directly

5. **Open a Pull Request**  
   - When you’re ready, submit your PR  
   - In the description, include: `Fixes #<issue-number>`  
     (This links your PR to the issue and closes it automatically)

6. **Review & Merge**  
   - A maintainer will review your code and leave comments if needed  
   - Once it’s approved, we’ll merge it and move the issue to “done.”

## 📝 Want to Contribute to the Docs?

   - Then comment and ask to be assigned.

2. **Submit a PR**  
   - Once assigned, make your edits and open a pull request.
   - In the description, include: `Fixes #<issue-number>`
