# Goroutine Leak Fix Summary

## Issue Description
A P0 goroutine leak was identified in the Stream Manager's metrics collection system. The monitoring goroutine in `metrics.go` (line 261) was running forever without a proper shutdown mechanism, causing memory leaks in long-running services.

## Root Cause
The `StreamMetrics` struct had a monitoring goroutine started in the `startSampling()` method that only listened to the `stopChan` channel but did not respect context cancellation from the parent stream manager. When the stream manager was shut down via context cancellation, the metrics goroutine would continue running indefinitely.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Context Support to StreamMetrics
- Added `ctx context.Context` and `cancel context.CancelFunc` fields to the `StreamMetrics` struct
- Created `NewStreamMetricsWithContext(parentCtx context.Context)` function to accept a parent context
- Modified the existing `NewStreamMetrics()` to call `NewStreamMetricsWithContext` with `context.Background()`

### 2. Updated Goroutine to Respect Context Cancellation
- Modified the monitoring goroutine in `startSampling()` to select on both `sm.ctx.Done()` and `sm.stopChan`
- This ensures the goroutine exits when either the context is cancelled or the stop channel is closed

### 3. Updated StreamManager to Pass Context
- Modified `stream_manager.go` to pass its context when creating metrics: `sm.metrics = NewStreamMetricsWithContext(ctx)`
- This ensures the metrics goroutine is tied to the stream manager's lifecycle

### 4. Enhanced Close Method
- Updated `Close()` method to call `sm.cancel()` before closing channels
- This provides a clean shutdown path for the metrics goroutine

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/punk1290/git/workspace2/ag-ui/go-sdk/pkg/encoding/streaming/metrics.go`
   - Added context support to StreamMetrics struct
   - Created NewStreamMetricsWithContext function
   - Updated startSampling goroutine to respect context cancellation
   - Enhanced Close method with context cancellation

2. `/Users/punk1290/git/workspace2/ag-ui/go-sdk/pkg/encoding/streaming/stream_manager.go`
   - Updated metrics initialization to pass the stream manager's context

3. `/Users/punk1290/git/workspace2/ag-ui/go-sdk/pkg/encoding/streaming/goroutine_leak_test.go`
   - Created comprehensive tests to verify no goroutine leaks occur
   - Tests verify proper cleanup on context cancellation and explicit Stop() calls

## Test Results
All goroutine leak tests pass successfully:
- `TestStreamManagerNoGoroutineLeak`: Verifies no leak when creating/stopping multiple stream managers
- `TestStreamMetricsNoGoroutineLeak`: Verifies no leak when creating/closing multiple metrics instances
- `TestStreamManagerContextCancellation`: Verifies proper cleanup when stream manager is stopped
- `TestMetricsParentContextCancellation`: Verifies metrics goroutine stops when parent context is cancelled

## Impact
This fix prevents memory leaks in long-running services that use the AG-UI SDK's streaming functionality. The goroutine now properly exits when:
1. The stream manager is stopped via `Stop()`
2. The parent context is cancelled
3. The metrics are explicitly closed via `Close()`

## Best Practices Applied
1. Always tie background goroutines to a context for proper lifecycle management
2. Provide both context cancellation and explicit close mechanisms
3. Test for goroutine leaks using runtime.NumGoroutine() comparisons
4. Ensure all goroutines have a clear exit path
