# Memory Leak Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical memory leak issues in the state management system where unbounded maps were causing memory exhaustion.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Unbounded activeContexts (sync.Map)
**Location**: `go-sdk/pkg/state/manager.go:96`
- **Problem**: The `activeContexts sync.Map` grew indefinitely without cleanup
- **Solution**: Replaced with bounded `ContextManager` using LRU eviction

### 2. Unbounded customResolvers Map
**Location**: `go-sdk/pkg/state/conflict.go:232`
- **Problem**: The `customResolvers map[string]CustomResolverFunc` had no size limits
- **Solution**: Replaced with `BoundedResolverRegistry` with configurable size limits

## Implementation Details

### New Components Created

1. **ContextManager** (`go-sdk/pkg/state/context_manager.go`)
   - Bounded LRU cache for managing state contexts
   - Max size configurable (default: 1000)
   - Automatic eviction of least recently used contexts
   - Thread-safe with proper locking
   - TTL-based cleanup support

2. **BoundedResolverRegistry** (`go-sdk/pkg/state/bounded_resolver_registry.go`)
   - Bounded registry for custom conflict resolvers
   - Max size: 100 resolvers
   - LRU eviction when at capacity
   - Access time tracking for cleanup
   - Thread-safe operations

### Files Modified

1. **go-sdk/pkg/state/manager.go**
   - Changed `activeContexts` from `sync.Map` to `*ContextManager`
   - Updated all context operations to use new API
   - Added proper initialization with size limits
   - Added atomic `closing` flag for graceful shutdown

2. **go-sdk/pkg/state/conflict.go**
   - Changed `customResolvers` from `map[string]CustomResolverFunc` to `*BoundedResolverRegistry`
   - Updated resolver registration and retrieval methods
   - Maintained backward compatibility with error logging

### Key Features

1. **Memory Bounds**
   - Contexts limited to `ManagerOptions.CacheSize` (default: 1000)
   - Resolvers limited to 100 entries
   - Both use LRU eviction to stay within bounds

2. **Performance**
   - O(1) Get/Put operations
   - Minimal lock contention
   - Efficient memory usage

3. **Monitoring**
   - Size tracking via metrics
   - Statistics available for both components
   - Capacity monitoring

4. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive test suite in `memory_leak_test.go`
   - Tests for bounded size, concurrent access, and memory growth
   - All tests passing

## Configuration

To adjust memory limits:

```go
opts := DefaultManagerOptions()
opts.CacheSize = 5000  // Allow up to 5000 contexts
sm, _ := NewStateManager(opts)
```

## Verification

Run tests to verify the fixes:
```bash
go test ./pkg/state -run "MemoryLeak|ContextManager|BoundedResolver" -v
```

## Impact

- **Memory Usage**: Now bounded and predictable
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead from LRU tracking
- **Compatibility**: No breaking API changes
- **Safety**: Thread-safe implementations with proper locking

## Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation in:
- `go-sdk/pkg/state/MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md` - Detailed memory management guide

## Next Steps

1. Monitor memory usage in production
2. Adjust size limits based on actual usage patterns
3. Consider adding metrics/alerting for when limits are approached
4. Potentially make resolver registry size configurable
