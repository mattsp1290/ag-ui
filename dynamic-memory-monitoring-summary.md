# Dynamic Memory Monitoring Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented dynamic memory monitoring to replace the fixed 5-second interval in `performance.go` at line 1069. The system now adapts monitoring frequency based on actual memory pressure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified MemoryManager Structure (`performance.go`)
- Added `currentInterval` field to track the current monitoring interval
- Added `lastPressure` field to track the last calculated memory pressure
- Added `checkNow` channel to support immediate checks for testing

### 2. Implemented Dynamic Monitoring Logic
- Created `calculateMemoryPressure()` method to calculate memory usage as a percentage
- Created `getMonitoringInterval()` method to determine appropriate interval based on pressure:
  - Low pressure (<50%): 60-second intervals
  - Medium pressure (50-70%): 15-second intervals
  - High pressure (85%+): 2-second intervals
  - Critical pressure (95%+): 500ms intervals
- Modified `Start()` method to use dynamic intervals instead of fixed 5-second ticker
- Added `performCheck()` helper method to handle memory checks and interval updates
- Added `TriggerCheck()` method for testing purposes

### 3. Enhanced Statistics and Monitoring
- Updated `GetStats()` to include memory pressure percentage and current monitoring interval
- Added `GetMemoryPressure()` method to expose current memory pressure
- Added `GetMonitoringInterval()` method to expose current monitoring interval
- Updated `checkMemoryUsage()` to track memory pressure

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Updated `PERFORMANCE_README.md` to document the dynamic memory monitoring feature
- Added section explaining the pressure-based interval ranges
- Updated code examples to show how to monitor memory pressure and intervals

### 5. Added Tests
- Created `TestDynamicMemoryMonitoring` to verify:
  - Correct interval calculation for different pressure levels
  - Dynamic adjustment during runtime
  - Proper pressure calculation
- Updated existing memory manager test to ensure compatibility

## Key Benefits
1. **Reduced Overhead**: During low memory pressure, monitoring happens less frequently (60s vs 5s)
2. **Rapid Response**: During high pressure, monitoring increases to 2s or even 500ms intervals
3. **Adaptive**: System automatically adjusts based on actual conditions
4. **Testable**: Added support for triggering immediate checks for testing

- `/Users/punk1290/git/workspace3/ag-ui/go-sdk/pkg/transport/websocket/PERFORMANCE_README.md`

## Testing
All dynamic memory monitoring tests pass successfully:
```
=== RUN   TestDynamicMemoryMonitoring
    performance_minimal_test.go:294: Current pressure: 60.95%, Current interval: 15s
--- PASS: TestDynamicMemoryMonitoring (0.30s)
```

The implementation provides a robust, adaptive memory monitoring system that scales monitoring frequency based on actual memory conditions while maintaining performance.
