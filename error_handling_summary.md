# Goroutine Error Handling Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Error Channel to StateManager
- Added `errCh chan error` field to the `StateManager` struct
- Initialized with buffer size of 100 in `NewStateManager`
- Properly closed in the `Close` method with draining

### 2. Implemented Error Handler Goroutine
- Created `handleErrors()` method that processes errors from the error channel
- Implements circuit breaker logic with error counting and automatic reset
- Can trigger degraded mode when error thresholds are exceeded
- Categories errors by type (checkpoint, event, update, metrics, unknown)

### 3. Added Error Reporting Helper
- Created `reportError()` method for safe, non-blocking error reporting
- Handles cases where error channel is full or manager is shutting down
- Falls back to direct logging if channel send would block

### 4. Updated All Goroutines
Added panic recovery and error reporting to all goroutines:
- `processUpdates()` - handles update processing errors
- `processEvents()` - handles event processing errors  
- `autoCheckpoint()` - handles checkpoint creation errors
- `collectMetrics()` - handles metrics collection errors
- `contextCleanup()` - handles context cleanup errors
- `cleanupExpiredContexts()` - wrapped in goroutine with panic recovery

### 5. Enhanced StateStore Error Handling
- Added `errorHandler` field to StateStore
- Added `SetErrorHandler()` method
- Updated `notifySubscribers()` to report panics through error handler
- StateManager sets its error handler on the store during initialization

### 6. Circuit Breaker Implementation
- `shouldCircuitBreak()` checks error counts by type:
  - Update errors: triggers at 10+ errors
  - Checkpoint errors: triggers at 5+ errors
  - Other errors: triggers at 20+ errors
- `enterDegradedMode()` emits a system.degraded event
- Error counts reset every 5 minutes

### 7. Updated Error Reporting
Changed direct logging to error channel reporting:
- `createAutoCheckpoints()` - reports checkpoint failures
- `processEvents()` - reports event processing failures
- `processSingleUpdate()` - reports checkpoint creation failures

## Benefits

1. **No Silent Failures**: All goroutine errors are now properly propagated
2. **Graceful Degradation**: System can enter degraded mode instead of crashing
3. **Better Observability**: All errors flow through central handler
4. **Panic Recovery**: All goroutines recover from panics and report them
5. **Non-Blocking**: Error reporting never blocks goroutine execution
6. **Proper Shutdown**: Error channel is properly drained during shutdown

## Follow Go Best Practices

The implementation follows the review requirements:
- Errors from goroutines are propagated through channels
- Panic recovery is in place for all goroutines
- Circuit breaker logic prevents cascade failures
- Non-blocking error reporting prevents deadlocks
- Proper cleanup and shutdown handling
