# Context Cancellation Handling Fixes

## Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive context cancellation fixes implemented across the AG-UI Go SDK encoding system to ensure proper responsiveness and resource management in production systems.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. RoundTripValidator Context Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location**: `pkg/encoding/validation/validator.go`

**Problem**: `ValidateRoundTrip` and `ValidateRoundTripMultiple` methods were using `context.Background()` instead of the provided context parameter, making them unresponsive to cancellation.

**Fix**: 
- Replaced `context.Background()` with the provided `ctx` parameter in both methods
- Added context cancellation checks before and after encoding/decoding operations
- Added periodic context checks during multiple event validation (every 100 events)

### 2. ChunkedEncoder Context Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location**: `pkg/encoding/streaming/chunked_encoder.go`

**Problem**: The `encodeChunk` method was using `context.Background()` instead of respecting the caller's context.

**Fix**:
- Created `encodeChunkWithContext` method that properly accepts and uses context
- Updated all calls to `encodeChunk` to use the new context-aware version
- Added context cancellation checks before encoding operations

### 3. StreamManager Context Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)  
**Location**: `pkg/encoding/streaming/stream_manager.go`

**Problem**: Worker methods (`writeWorker` and `readWorker`) were using `context.Background()` for encoder/decoder operations.

**Fix**:
- Updated `writeWorker` to use the stream manager's context (`sm.ctx`) for encoding operations
- Updated `readWorker` to use the stream manager's context for decoding operations
- Added context cancellation checks before read/write operations

### 4. Security Validation Long-Running Operations (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Location**: `pkg/encoding/validation/security.go`

**Problem**: Long-running validation operations didn't check for context cancellation, making them uninterruptible.

**Fix**:
- Added context parameter to internal validation methods (`validateFormat`, `validateInjectionPatterns`, `validateDOSPatterns`, `validateNestingDepth`, `validateRepetition`)
- Added periodic context cancellation checks in loops processing large datasets
- Added context checks before expensive operations like regex matching and deep structure traversal

### 5. Network Transport Context Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location**: `pkg/transport/websocket/transport.go`

**Problem**: Event handler execution was using `context.Background()` instead of the transport's context.

**Fix**:
- Updated handler execution to use transport context (`t.ctx`) instead of `context.Background()`
- Added context cancellation checks before processing each handler
- Ensured proper context inheritance for handler timeouts

## Partial Operation Handling

### Cleanup Mechanisms
- **Unified Streaming**: Added goroutine to drain remaining chunks when context is cancelled to prevent leaks
- **Stream Manager**: Enhanced context cancellation paths to ensure proper cleanup of read/write operations
- **Chunked Encoding**: Proper cleanup of worker goroutines when parallel processing is cancelled

### State Consistency
- Operations that are cancelled mid-execution don't leave the system in an inconsistent state
- Encoders and validators remain functional after context cancellation
- Resource pools and buffers are properly returned even on cancellation

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Tests Created
1. **Context Cancellation Tests** (`context_cancellation_test.go`):
   - JSON encoder context cancellation (immediate and timeout)
   - Round-trip validator context cancellation
   - Chunked encoder context cancellation (sequential and parallel)
   - Stream manager context cancellation
   - Security validator context cancellation
   - Unified streaming context cancellation

2. **Partial Operations Tests** (`partial_operations_test.go`):
   - Cleanup verification for cancelled operations
   - State consistency after cancellation
   - Concurrent cancellation handling
   - Goroutine leak prevention

### Test Coverage Areas
- **Immediate Cancellation**: Tests with contexts cancelled before operation starts
- **Timeout Cancellation**: Tests with contexts that timeout during operation
- **Periodic Checks**: Verification that long-running operations check context periodically
- **Resource Cleanup**: Ensuring no goroutine leaks or resource leaks
- **State Recovery**: Verifying systems remain functional after cancellation

## Implementation Patterns

### Context Check Pattern
```go
// Check context cancellation before expensive operations
if err := ctx.Err(); err != nil {
    return errors.NewEncodingError("operation_cancelled", "operation cancelled").WithCause(err)
}
```

### Periodic Context Checks
```go
// Check context periodically in loops
for i, item := range largeDataset {
    if i%100 == 0 { // Check every 100 iterations
        if err := ctx.Err(); err != nil {
            return errors.NewEncodingError("operation_cancelled", "operation cancelled during processing").WithCause(err)
        }
    }
    // Process item...
}
```

### Proper Context Inheritance
```go
// Use provided context instead of context.Background()
handlerCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(t.ctx, t.config.EventTimeout)
defer cancel()
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Responsiveness**: Operations can be cancelled promptly when clients disconnect or timeout
2. **Resource Management**: Prevents resource leaks from long-running operations that can't be stopped
3. **Production Reliability**: Systems can gracefully handle timeouts and cancellations without hanging
4. **Better User Experience**: Applications can provide timely feedback when operations are cancelled
5. **System Stability**: Prevents accumulation of stuck operations that could degrade performance

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility:
- Public APIs remain unchanged
- Existing behavior is preserved when contexts are not cancelled
- No breaking changes to method signatures
- Internal implementation improvements only

## Future Recommendations

1. **Monitoring**: Add metrics for context cancellation rates to monitor system health
2. **Tuning**: Adjust periodic check frequencies based on performance requirements
3. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to highlight context cancellation behavior
4. **Training**: Educate developers on proper context usage patterns
5. **Testing**: Add context cancellation tests to CI/CD pipeline

## Critical for Production

These fixes are essential for production systems because:
- They prevent resource exhaustion from uninterruptible operations
- They enable proper load balancing and failover scenarios
- They improve system responsiveness under load
- They prevent cascade failures when operations can't be cancelled
- They ensure proper cleanup in microservice architectures

The implementation ensures that all encoding, validation, and streaming operations respect context cancellation, making the system much more robust and responsive in production environments.
