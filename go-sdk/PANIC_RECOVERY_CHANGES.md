# Panic Recovery Changes Summary

This document summarizes all the goroutines that have been updated with panic recovery handlers to prevent application crashes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Error Handlers (`pkg/errors/error_handlers.go`)
- **NotificationHandler.Handle()**: Added panic recovery for notification goroutine
- **NotificationHandler.HandleWithSeverity()**: Added panic recovery for notification goroutine with severity

### 2. State Manager (`pkg/state/manager.go`)
- **Audit logging goroutines**: Added panic recovery for all audit log background goroutines (4 instances)
- **Shutdown wait goroutine**: Added panic recovery for the goroutine that waits for workers during shutdown
- **Channel drain goroutines**: Added panic recovery for updateQueue, eventQueue, and errCh drain goroutines
- **cleanupExpiredContexts**: Already had panic recovery (good!)

### 3. Monitoring Integration (`pkg/core/events/monitoring/monitoring_integration.go`)
- **Prometheus exporter start**: Added panic recovery
- **Alert manager start**: Added panic recovery
- **SLA monitor start**: Added panic recovery
- **Auto-generate dashboards**: Added panic recovery

### 4. Alert Manager (`pkg/core/events/monitoring/alert_manager.go`)
- **Alert evaluation routine**: Added panic recovery
- **Alert processing routine**: Added panic recovery

### 5. Prometheus Exporter (`pkg/core/events/monitoring/prometheus_exporter.go`)
- **Metrics update routine**: Added panic recovery
- **HTTP server goroutine**: Added panic recovery
- **Server shutdown goroutine**: Added panic recovery for context cancellation listener

### 6. Distributed Validator (`pkg/core/events/distributed/distributed_validator.go`)
- **Broadcast to nodes**: Added panic recovery for network communication placeholder
- **Heartbeat routine**: Added panic recovery
- **Cleanup routine**: Added panic recovery
- **Metrics routine**: Added panic recovery

### 7. Partition Handler (`pkg/core/events/distributed/partition_handler.go`)
- **Heartbeat detection**: Added panic recovery
- **Quorum detection**: Added panic recovery
- **Gossip detection**: Added panic recovery
- **Hybrid mode detection**: Added panic recovery for all three detection methods
- **Recovery routine**: Added panic recovery
- **Cleanup routine**: Added panic recovery
- **Partition detected callback**: Added panic recovery

### 8. State Synchronizer (`pkg/core/events/distributed/state_sync.go`)
- **Gossip sync routine**: Added panic recovery
- **Merkle sync routine**: Added panic recovery
- **CRDT sync routine**: Added panic recovery
- **Snapshot sync routine**: Added panic recovery
- **Sync queue processor**: Added panic recovery
- **Cleanup routine**: Added panic recovery
- **Gossip update trigger**: Added panic recovery
- **Send gossip updates**: Added panic recovery for each node
- **Sync completion waiter**: Already had panic recovery (good!)

## Panic Recovery Pattern Used

All goroutines now follow this pattern:

```go
go func() {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            // Log the panic appropriately
            // Using fmt.Printf, logger.Error, or other appropriate logging
        }
    }()
    // Original goroutine code
}()
```

## Important Notes

1. **Logging**: Different logging mechanisms are used based on context:
   - `fmt.Printf`: Used in monitoring and distributed components
   - `logger.Error`: Used in components with access to a logger instance
   - All panics are logged with descriptive messages indicating the source

2. **Consistency**: All panic recovery follows the same pattern for consistency

3. **Test Files**: Test goroutines were not modified as panic in tests should fail the test

4. **Channel Safety**: The state sync completion goroutine ensures the done channel is closed even if a panic occurs

## Verification

To verify no goroutines were missed, the following patterns were searched:
- `go func(`
- `go \w+\.\w+\(`
- Background routine start patterns in Start() methods

All identified goroutines in production code now have panic recovery.
