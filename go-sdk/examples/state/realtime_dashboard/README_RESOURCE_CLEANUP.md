# Real-Time Dashboard - Resource Cleanup Implementation

This document describes the resource cleanup improvements made to the real-time dashboard example.

## Overview

The real-time dashboard example has been enhanced with comprehensive resource cleanup to ensure proper shutdown and prevent resource leaks. The implementation follows Go best practices for graceful shutdown and coordinated resource cleanup.

## Key Improvements

### 1. HTTP Server Graceful Shutdown

- Added HTTP server with graceful shutdown support
- Server listens on port 8080 with health check endpoint
- Proper context-based shutdown with timeout

```go
// Shutdown HTTP server
if err := server.httpServer.Shutdown(shutdownCtx); err != nil {
    log.Printf("HTTP server shutdown error: %v", err)
}
```

### 2. Event Stream and Subscription Cleanup

- Proper stopping of event streams
- Tracking and unsubscribing all event subscriptions
- Thread-safe subscription management with mutex

```go
// Track subscriptions for cleanup
var subscriptions []func()
var subMu sync.Mutex

// During shutdown
subMu.Lock()
for _, unsub := range subscriptions {
    unsub()
}
subMu.Unlock()
```

### 3. Context Cancellation in All Goroutines

- Main context that propagates cancellation to all child contexts
- Individual contexts for different subsystems
- All goroutines check context.Done() for cancellation

```go
select {
case <-ctx.Done():
    return
case <-ticker.C:
    // Do work
}
```

### 4. Coordinated Shutdown with Timeouts

- Three-phase shutdown process:
  1. Stop accepting new work
  2. Wait for existing work to complete
  3. Final cleanup
- 10-second timeout for graceful shutdown
- Proper error handling for timeout scenarios

```go
shutdownCtx, shutdownCancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
defer shutdownCancel()
```

### 5. Channel Closure After Writers Finish

- WaitGroup to track active goroutines
- Channels closed only after all writers complete
- Prevents panic from sending on closed channels

## Signal Handling

The application now properly handles interrupt signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM):

```go
sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
signal.Notify(sigChan, os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM)
```

## Resource Cleanup Flow

1. **Signal Reception**: Application receives shutdown signal or timeout
2. **Context Cancellation**: Main context is cancelled, propagating to all children
3. **Stop New Work**: Event streams and handlers stop accepting new work
4. **Drain Existing Work**: Wait for in-flight operations to complete
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Close connections, unsubscribe events, stop servers
6. **Final Statistics**: Display performance metrics before exit

## Testing

Comprehensive tests have been added to verify resource cleanup:

- `TestGracefulShutdown`: Verifies collector cleanup with timeout
- `TestHTTPServerShutdown`: Tests HTTP server graceful shutdown
- `TestClientDisconnection`: Ensures all clients are properly disconnected
- `TestContextCancellation`: Validates goroutines respect context cancellation
- `TestChannelClosure`: Verifies channels are properly closed

## Running the Example

```bash
# Run the dashboard
go run main.go

# In another terminal, send interrupt signal
# Press Ctrl+C or:
kill -SIGTERM <pid>
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Always use contexts** for cancellation propagation
2. **Track goroutines** with WaitGroups
3. **Set timeouts** for shutdown operations
4. **Clean up in reverse order** of initialization
5. **Log all cleanup steps** for debugging
6. **Handle errors gracefully** during shutdown
7. **Test resource cleanup** thoroughly

## Performance Impact

The resource cleanup implementation has minimal performance impact:
- Context checks are lightweight
- WaitGroup operations are efficient
- Cleanup code only runs during shutdown
- No impact on steady-state performance
