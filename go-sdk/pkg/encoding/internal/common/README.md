# Internal Common Package

This package provides internal utilities shared across the encoding package implementations. It is **not intended for external use** and its API may change without notice.

## Package Structure

- **errors.go**: Common error types and error handling utilities
- **validation.go**: Shared validation functions for input validation  
- **buffers.go**: Buffer management utilities including pooling and safe access
- **patterns.go**: Common interfaces and patterns used across encoding implementations
- **doc.go**: Package documentation

## Purpose

This package was created as part of Phase 3 of the encoding system refactoring to:

1. **Extract Common Patterns**: Centralize common code patterns used across different encoding implementations
2. **Standardize Error Handling**: Provide consistent error types and handling mechanisms
3. **Optimize Buffer Management**: Offer efficient buffer pooling and thread-safe buffer operations
4. **Define Common Interfaces**: Establish standard interfaces for encoding/decoding operations
5. **Improve Maintainability**: Reduce code duplication and improve code organization

## Internal Use Only

This package is internal to the encoding package and should not be imported or used by external code. The APIs provided here may change without notice as part of internal refactoring and improvements.

## Thread Safety

Unless explicitly documented otherwise, the utilities in this package are not thread-safe and should be used with appropriate synchronization when accessed from multiple goroutines. The `SafeBuffer` type is an exception and provides thread-safe operations.

## Testing

The package includes comprehensive tests to ensure all utilities work correctly:

```bash
go test ./pkg/encoding/internal/common/
```

## Future Enhancements

This package will be extended as more common patterns are identified during the refactoring process. New utilities will be added to support the needs of the encoding implementations.
