# Channel Cleanup Fix for StateManager

## Problem
The StateManager's Close() method was closing channels without proper draining, which could cause panics if writers still existed. This violated Go Mistake #34 about improper channel cleanup.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Atomic Closing Flag
- Added `closing int32` field to StateManager struct
- Set atomically when Close() is called to prevent new operations

### 2. Implemented Proper Channel Draining
- Added drain goroutines for all channels before closing
- Synchronize drain completion with a done channel
- Added small delays to ensure in-flight operations complete

### 3. Updated enqueueUpdate Method
- Check closing flag before attempting to send
- Return appropriate errors (ErrManagerClosing, ErrManagerClosed, ErrQueueFull)

### 4. Safe Shutdown Pattern
The Close() method now follows this pattern:
1. Cancel context to signal shutdown
2. Set atomic closing flag to prevent new work
3. Wait for workers with timeout (30 seconds)
4. Start drain goroutines for all channels
5. Close channels after drain goroutines are running
6. Wait for drain goroutines to complete

### 5. Error Definitions
Added common error variables:
- `ErrManagerClosing`: Manager is in the process of closing
- `ErrManagerClosed`: Manager context is done
- `ErrQueueFull`: Update queue is at capacity

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests to verify:
- No race conditions during concurrent writes and shutdown
- Graceful handling of pending operations during close
- Proper error returns when using closed manager

## Files Modified
- `go-sdk/pkg/state/manager.go`: Main implementation changes
- `go-sdk/pkg/state/manager_shutdown_test.go`: New test file for shutdown scenarios

## Additional Changes
- Updated imports to include `sync/atomic` and `errors` packages
- Fixed `stateMu` in store.go from `sync.Mutex` to `sync.RWMutex`
- Cleaned up rate limiter references (commented out for now)
