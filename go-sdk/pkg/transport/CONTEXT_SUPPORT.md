# Context Support Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added proper context.Context handling to all Transport interface implementations for cancellation and timeout support, which is a critical Go best practice for production systems.

## Changes Made

### 1. Transport Interface (interface.go)
The Transport interface already had context support in its method signatures:
- `Connect(ctx context.Context) error`
- `Send(ctx context.Context, event TransportEvent) error`
- `Close(ctx context.Context) error`
- `Health(ctx context.Context) error`

### 2. Updated Implementations

#### DemoTransport (demo_test.go)
- Added context cancellation check in `Connect()` method
- Added context cancellation check in `Send()` method with select statement
- Added context cancellation check in `Close()` method
- Added context cancellation check in `Health()` method

#### MockTransport (benchmark_test.go)
- Added context cancellation check in `Connect()` method
- Updated `Send()` method to use `select` with `time.After()` instead of `time.Sleep()` for proper context handling
- Added context cancellation check in `Close()` method
- Added context cancellation check in `Health()` method

#### RaceTestTransport (race_test.go)
- Already had proper context handling in `Connect()` and `Send()` methods
- Added context cancellation check in `Close()` method

#### ErrorTransport (error_test.go)
- Already had proper context handling in all methods using `select` statements with delays

### 3. Context Handling Pattern
The consistent pattern used across all implementations:

```go
// For methods without delays
select {
case <-ctx.Done():
    return ctx.Err()
default:
}

// For methods with delays
select {
case <-time.After(delay):
    // Continue with operation
case <-ctx.Done():
    return ctx.Err()
}
```

### 4. Test Coverage
Added comprehensive test suite in `context_test.go` to verify:
- Context cancellation is respected in all methods
- Context timeout is properly handled
- Operations can be interrupted mid-execution

## Benefits
1. **Graceful Shutdown**: Services can cleanly shut down by cancelling contexts
2. **Timeout Control**: Operations can have configurable timeouts
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Prevents goroutine leaks and hanging operations
4. **Production Ready**: Follows Go best practices for production systems

## Testing
All context handling tests pass successfully:
- TestDemoTransportContextHandling
- TestMockTransportContextHandling
- TestErrorTransportContextHandling
- TestRaceTestTransportContextHandling

The existing TestContextCancellation test also continues to pass.
