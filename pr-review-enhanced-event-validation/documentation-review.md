   - Component-specific READMEs for distributed (817 lines), cache (735 lines), monitoring (300+ lines), and other subsystems
   - Clear architecture diagrams using ASCII art
   - Extensive code examples throughout

2. **Migration Guide** 
   - Detailed 574-line migration guide covering breaking changes, step-by-step instructions, and rollback procedures
   - Feature comparison tables between base and enhanced systems
   - Configuration migration examples
   - Performance considerations and optimization tips

3. **Performance Documentation**
   - Comprehensive 1694-line performance debugging guide
   - Detailed profiling techniques and diagnostic commands
   - Real-world troubleshooting scenarios
   - Performance benchmarking instructions

4. **API Documentation**
   - Complete API reference coverage in docs/README.md
   - Client APIs guide with authentication patterns
   - Event validation guide with advanced features
   - Production deployment documentation

5. **Example Documentation**
   - Well-documented authentication middleware example (346 lines)
   - Clear usage instructions and test scenarios
   - Security best practices and integration patterns

6. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Clear system architecture diagrams
   - Component relationship explanations
   - Deployment architecture for production

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

1. **Missing API Reference Details**
   - The docs/api-reference.md file referenced in docs/README.md was not found in the diff
   - Need complete API documentation with method signatures and parameters

2. **Limited Code Comments**
   - While external documentation is excellent, inline code comments could be enhanced
   - Complex algorithms (consensus, state synchronization) would benefit from more detailed inline documentation

3. **Missing Quick Start Guide**
   - No simple "Getting Started in 5 Minutes" guide for new users
   - Would help developers quickly evaluate the SDK

4. **Incomplete Troubleshooting Section**
   - While individual components have troubleshooting, a centralized troubleshooting guide would be helpful
   - Common error codes and their resolutions

5. **Version Compatibility Matrix**
   - Limited version compatibility information
   - Should document minimum Go version, dependency versions

## Suggestions for Missing Documentation

### 1. Quick Start Guide (Recommended Addition)
```markdown
# Quick Start Guide

## Installation
```bash
go get github.com/ag-ui/go-sdk@enhanced-event-validation
```

## Basic Usage (5 minutes)
```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"
    "github.com/ag-ui/go-sdk/pkg/core/events"
)

func main() {
    // Create validator with defaults
    validator := events.NewEventValidator(events.DefaultValidationConfig())
    
    // Create an event
    event := &events.RunStartedEvent{
        BaseEvent: &events.BaseEvent{
            EventType: events.EventTypeRunStarted,
            TimestampMs: timePtr(time.Now().UnixMilli()),
        },
        RunIDValue: "run-123",
        ThreadIDValue: "thread-1",
    }
    
    // Validate
    result := validator.ValidateEvent(context.Background(), event)
    if !result.IsValid {
        log.Printf("Validation failed: %v", result.Errors)
    }
}
```
```

### 2. API Reference Template
```markdown
# API Reference

## Core APIs

### EventValidator

#### NewEventValidator
```go
func NewEventValidator(config *ValidationConfig) *EventValidator
```
Creates a new event validator with the specified configuration.

**Parameters:**
- `config`: Validation configuration (nil for defaults)

**Returns:**
- `*EventValidator`: Configured validator instance

**Example:**
```go
validator := events.NewEventValidator(events.DefaultValidationConfig())
```

[Continue for all public APIs...]
```

### 3. Centralized Error Reference
```markdown
# Error Reference

## Validation Errors

| Error Code | Description | Common Causes | Resolution |
|------------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| MISSING_TIMESTAMP | Event timestamp is missing | Event created without timestamp | Set TimestampMs field |
| INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION | State transition not allowed | Invalid state machine flow | Check allowed transitions |
| CONSENSUS_TIMEOUT | Distributed consensus failed | Network issues, node failures | Check node connectivity |
| CACHE_MISS | Cache lookup failed | Entry expired or not cached | Normal behavior, will validate |
```

### 4. Deployment Checklist
```markdown
# Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-deployment
- [ ] Review security configuration
- [ ] Set appropriate resource limits
- [ ] Configure monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Test rollback procedures
- [ ] Verify network policies

## Post-deployment
- [ ] Verify metrics collection
- [ ] Check distributed node discovery
- [ ] Test failover scenarios
- [ ] Monitor error rates
```

## Documentation Quality Metrics

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Completeness | 8/10 | Comprehensive but missing some API details |
| Clarity | 9/10 | Very clear with excellent examples |
| Organization | 9/10 | Well-structured with good navigation |
| Technical Accuracy | 9/10 | Accurate and up-to-date |
| Examples | 10/10 | Extensive, working examples |
| Diagrams | 8/10 | Good ASCII diagrams, could add more |
| Troubleshooting | 7/10 | Good component-specific, needs centralization |

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add Missing API Reference** - Create comprehensive API documentation with all public methods
2. **Create Quick Start Guide** - 5-minute guide for new developers
3. **Enhance Code Comments** - Add inline documentation for complex algorithms

### Medium Priority
4. **Centralize Troubleshooting** - Create unified troubleshooting guide
5. **Add Version Matrix** - Document compatibility requirements
6. **Create FAQ Section** - Address common questions

### Low Priority
7. **Add Video Tutorials** - Screen recordings for complex features
8. **Create Architecture Decision Records** - Document design decisions
9. **Add Performance Tuning Guide** - Advanced optimization techniques

## Conclusion

The documentation in this PR represents a significant improvement to the AG-UI Go SDK. It demonstrates professional standards with comprehensive coverage of features, clear examples, and production-ready guidance. With the suggested additions, particularly the API reference and quick start guide, the documentation would achieve excellence in supporting both new and experienced developers.

The extensive troubleshooting sections in component documentation show deep consideration for operational concerns, which is commendable. The migration guide is particularly well-done, showing careful attention to backward compatibility and user experience during upgrades.
