## Issues Analysis

### Critical Issues (✅ RESOLVED)

#### 1. Event Processing Pipeline
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** in commit c33e9fe
- **Issue**: Initial implementation had busy-waiting loops
- **Resolution**: Proper channel-based event processing implemented
- **Impact**: Eliminates CPU waste and improves scalability

#### 2. Handler Removal Bug  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** in commit c33e9fe
- **Issue**: Handler removal used unreliable pointer comparison
- **Resolution**: Unique ID-based handler tracking with EventHandlerWrapper
- **Impact**: Prevents memory leaks and ensures proper cleanup

### Minor Issues (Suggestions for Future Improvement)

#### 1. Zero-Copy String Conversion
**Location**: `performance.go:717-721`
**Issue**: String() method creates copy, defeating zero-copy purpose
```go
func (zcb *ZeroCopyBuffer) String() string {
    return string(zcb.data[zcb.offset:]) // Creates copy
}
```
**Suggestion**: Use unsafe package for true zero-copy conversion
**Severity**: Minor - Performance optimization

#### 2. Memory Management Granularity
**Location**: `performance.go:1069`
**Issue**: Memory pressure check interval too coarse (5 seconds)
```go
ticker := time.NewTicker(5 * time.Second)
```
**Suggestion**: More frequent checks (1-2 seconds) or dynamic intervals
**Severity**: Minor - Performance tuning

#### 3. Potential Lock Contention
**Location**: `security.go:401-412`
**Issue**: Global mutex in getClientLimiter could become bottleneck
**Suggestion**: Consider sync.Map for better concurrent access
**Severity**: Minor - Scalability consideration

## Code Quality Assessment

### Positive Aspects ✅
- **Concurrency Safety**: Excellent use of mutexes and atomic operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with proper wrapping
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup with defer statements and context cancellation

#### Recommendations for Enhancement
1. **Compression Attack Protection**: Add compression bomb protection for deflate/gzip
2. **Connection Timeouts**: Implement connection-level timeouts to prevent slow loris attacks
3. **Frame Validation**: Add WebSocket frame validation for malformed messages
4. **IP-based Blocking**: Consider IP-based blocking for repeated authentication failures
