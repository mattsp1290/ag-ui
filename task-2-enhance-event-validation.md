# Enhance Event Validation & Testing

## Task Overview
Enhance the existing event validation system with comprehensive testing, performance optimizations, and advanced validation features to ensure robust AG-UI protocol compliance.

## Git Workflow
```bash
# Start with a new branch
git checkout -b phase2/enhance-event-validation
git push -u origin phase2/enhance-event-validation
```

## Background
The AG-UI Go SDK has a solid foundation for event validation in `pkg/core/events/validator.go` and related files. This task focuses on enhancing the validation system with advanced features, comprehensive testing, and performance optimizations.

## Tasks

### 1. Enhance Event Validation Engine
- **Location**: `go-sdk/pkg/core/events/validator.go`
- **Goal**: Add advanced validation capabilities:

  - Async validation for non-blocking operations
  - Validation result caching for performance
- **Requirements**:
  - Pluggable validation rules architecture
  - Context-aware validation
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Memory-efficient validation state

### 2. Implement Comprehensive Validation Rules
- **Location**: `go-sdk/pkg/core/events/rules/`
- **Goal**: Create specific validation rules for:

  - Message content validation
  - Tool call parameter validation
  - State transition validation
- **Requirements**:
  - Rule composition and chaining
  - Configurable severity levels
  - Detailed error reporting
  - Rule enablement/disablement

### 3. Add Performance Monitoring

### 5. Add Validation Debugging Tools
- **Location**: `go-sdk/pkg/core/events/debug.go`
- **Goal**: Developer-friendly debugging utilities:
  - Validation trace logging
  - Rule execution visualization
  - Event sequence replay
  - Validation error analysis
- **Requirements**:
  - Structured logging integration
  - Configurable debug levels
  - Export functionality for analysis
  - Integration with common debugging tools

### 6. Optimize Validation Performance
- **Location**: `go-sdk/pkg/core/events/performance.go`
- **Goal**: Performance optimizations:
  - Validation result caching
  - Parallel rule execution
  - Memory pool usage
  - Hot path optimization
- **Requirements**:
  - Maintain validation accuracy
  - Configurable performance modes
  - Memory usage reduction
  - CPU utilization optimization
